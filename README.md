# Guilherme
Welcome to my github profile!!

Full-stack software developer with proven experience in increasing operational efficiency and delivering scalable solutions. I am self-taught, proactive, and passionate about solving complex problems, adding value through technological innovation, and contributing solutions that transform businesses.
Currently, I am focusing on developing a Laravel product and learning more about Laravel during this process. I am also exploring Tailwind and Livewire, as well as diving into the Rust programming language. Below, I've listed some technologies I have worked with or learned throughout my career as a software developer.
This GitHub profile is new because I lost my previous one, so there's not much to show here yet. However, that will change! Over the next few years, I plan to focus on learning, contributing to open-source projects, and building both private and public projects
